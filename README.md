## Objectives

- Using Tableau to explore and visualize the dataset
- Using MySQL Workbench to query the database and gain insights
- Using Python and libraries in Jupyter Notebook to explore, clean, process and model the data

## Final Results

A full work-through of an end-to-end machine learning project with documentation and working files.
